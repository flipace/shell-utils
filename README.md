# shell-utils

This repository contains some small shell utilities/scripts
I use to make life with the command line nicer :)

### better-bash-profile

The setup shown in this structure is great if you want to split
commands of your .bash_profile into multiple files.

### Theme

I currently prefer the *"Galaxy"* theme from [lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes](https://github.com/lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes).
